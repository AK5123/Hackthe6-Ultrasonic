## Inspiration
In the challenging present times, many social-distancing aids have been created in order to enforce / assist in social distancing. Most of them are based on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. However they have their own inherent problems due to the nature of the 
Most current social-distancing aids are: 
* **Inaccurate:** Most social-distancing apps use Bluetooth which is unreliable in detecting exact distances due to its wide range (around 10m). 
* **Not cross-platform:** They do not usually work on both iOS and Android. 
* **Lack of privacy:** They pose a risk to usersâ€™ privacy as they collect sensitive data. 
* **Passive:** They do not prevent, rather aim to mitigate.

## Our Magic Solution

Our app sends and listens for near-ultrasonic sound to reliably detect any phone in a 2-3m radius to alert the user. It uses the attenuation of the signal strength along with other mechanisms to detect people only in close proximity. Each device acts as a trigger by sending waves constantly which are only picked up by nearby devices, while also listening for waves it can pick up to alert its user.
